# ConvTitanic

Deep learning applied on the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) with character quantization.

For a convolutional char-level approach, charachter quantization used on the `Name`, `Ticket` and `Cabin` features.

Since the dataset is relatively small, it is hard to get a satisfying performance. A [feature engineering approach](https://github.com/wphw/Titanic-Feature-Engineering) seems more convenient.
